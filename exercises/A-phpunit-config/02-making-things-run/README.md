# Exercise 02 - Making Things Run

You can run the tests for this exercises from the project root, by typing `./bin/phpunit --testsuite ex2`.

The `Subject1` and `Subject2` classes appear to be under test, but something is wrong, and the tests aren't running correctly.  Have
a look at the two test classes, and fix the problems to make things pass.  Pay careful attention to method names, classnames and
filenames.  When you see two passing tests for `./bin/phpunit --testsuite ex2`, you have finished the exercise.
