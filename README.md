# PHPUnit training

Provides information and exercises for PHPUnit.  Assumes familiarity with PHP, and a basic understanding of what unit testing
is.

Navigate into the `exercises` folder in your browser.  Each numbered exercise has a `README.md` file, with instructions.  At the
end of each section, there is a recap for you to read.

You will need PHP 5.6 or better, Composer and Git to do these exercises.  The training uses PHPUnit 5.3, and consequently does
not take account of (ATOW) very recent changes to Git's mocking API in 5.4+.
